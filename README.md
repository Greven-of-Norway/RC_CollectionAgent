This is a plugin for Lightroom created by Rob Cole. 

"CollectionAgent - Lightroom Plugin

Duplicate, sync, & copy collections and/or collection sets.

(same collection tree, or regular collections to publish services and vice versa).

Note: MiscLrScripts has 'Export Collections and Sets' and 'Import Collections and Sets' functions (which probably should have been in this plugin ;-})

Featuring:
* Maintain dumb collections with same contents as smart collections for syncability via Lr mobile.
* Duplicate collection set, or smart collection. (specifying a new name for duplicate).
* Synchronize smart collections or collection sets (assure settings match a selected reference).
* Copy collections or sets to and fro...
* Bonus Features:
** Edit selected photos as a collection.
** Divide and Conquor (spread selected photos into multiple collections)
** @v3.6, Lr5 users don't need to have smart collection definitions on disk to duplicate or sync collections/sets.
